# Logo2PWM

Logo2PWM is a tool to convert sequence logo back to position weight matrix. 

In the field of gene biology, there are often situations such that in a publication, only the sequence logos of the motifs are provided, however, the corresponding PWMs are hard to be acquired. In order to do more researches on these motifs, we need a tool to quickly and accurately convert the sequence logos back to PWMs, that is why we made Logo2PWM.
